# Object Classification

This repository contains an object classification study done as a homework within a college course. In the project, MATLAB language and environment used to classify the planes and helicopters in the image. You can see the image used in the project in the repository. 

Although the classification goal has not been achieved completely, the aim of this project was to accelerate the learning process by doing practice on an image that is close to real world challenges. 

A pdf file imported from the MATLAB environment in order to see the code outputs clearly and get a better understanding of the study.
